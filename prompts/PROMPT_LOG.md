# Prompt Log and Review Register

Every substantial AI-assisted change is recorded before implementation. Each entry contains the prompt, its CoSTAR structure, negative constraints, review notes, accepted changes, and verification evidence. Prompt entries are committed with the code they influenced.

| ID | Change | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| P001 | Establish project architecture and engineering workflow | Accepted | pending |
| P002 | Create auditable mock slotbook and student-preference fixtures | Accepted | pending |

## P001 - Project architecture and workflow

### CoSTAR prompt

**Context:** We are building a Java 17 IITM course-slotting application for a CS5013 mid-evaluation. The product must be understandable during an individual viva and must preserve a traceable AI-assisted engineering process.

**Objective:** Define a modular Maven project with explicit boundaries for parsing, validation, optimization, explanation, UI, export, and testing.

**Style:** Use small cohesive Java classes, immutable records where practical, descriptive names, and documentation aimed at a student who must explain every decision.

**Tone:** Precise, engineering-focused, and honest about synthetic data and limitations.

**Audience:** Course TAs, stakeholder, and team members maintaining the code.

**Response:** Provide the repository structure, build dependencies, architecture flow, and verification plan before implementing solver logic.

### Negative prompt / constraints

- Do not hide solver logic inside JavaFX controllers.
- Do not claim mock preferences are real IITM data.
- Do not use an LLM to invent assignment reasons.
- Do not add authentication, room optimization, or production deployment to the mid-evaluation scope.
- Do not commit generated build artifacts or secrets.

### Prompt review

- **Specificity:** Pass - language, modules, evaluation context, and exclusions are explicit.
- **Verifiability:** Pass - boundaries can be checked from package imports and tests.
- **Risk:** Low - no external side effects or private data.
- **Revision:** Added the requirement that explanations remain deterministic and evidence-backed.

### Acceptance and verification

- Accept a Maven skeleton containing Java 17, OR-Tools, JavaFX, and JUnit.
- Accept an architecture document with a one-way data flow.
- Verify that the project compiles before solver implementation is committed.

## P002 - Mock data and preference fixtures

### CoSTAR prompt

**Context:** The supplied EE slotbook contains historical course assignments but does not contain the private reasoning, student selections, or instructor constraints that produced them.

**Objective:** Create a small dataset that resembles the EE slotbook and supports hard conflicts, instructor penalties, historical stability, and student co-demand objectives.

**Style:** Human-readable CSV with stable identifiers and enough variety to exercise feasible and infeasible solver paths.

**Tone:** Transparent about provenance and suitable for a classroom demonstration.

**Audience:** Evaluators inspecting whether the application is solving a meaningful constraint problem.

**Response:** Produce a feasible 18-course fixture, 30 synthetic student preference profiles, and an infeasible fixed-conflict fixture.

### Negative prompt / constraints

- Do not represent synthetic student IDs or preferences as real IITM data.
- Do not include names, roll numbers, emails, or other personal student data.
- Do not copy the supplied historical slot as a hard assignment except for explicitly fixed courses.
- Do not create an infeasible default demonstration dataset.
- Do not add constraints that cannot be explained in plain language.

### Prompt review

- **Specificity:** Pass - scale, files, objectives, and infeasible case are defined.
- **Privacy:** Pass - identifiers S001-S030 are synthetic and contain no personal information.
- **Bias check:** Historical slots have a small stability cost but do not determine the answer.
- **Revision:** Added a separate infeasible fixture instead of corrupting the feasible fixture at runtime.

### Acceptance and verification

- Every course references known slots.
- Every hard-conflict endpoint references a known course.
- Every student selection references a known course.
- The feasible fixture must solve; the infeasible fixture must be rejected with a specific fixed-conflict diagnostic.
